## TalkGPT: A way to talk to the LLM

This app allows anyone to use their voice to ask a large language model (such as the new Llama3) and question they want. It then takes this, converts it to text, puts it into the model, and speaks it back to you. This is perfect for adding to any smart home project you desire.
